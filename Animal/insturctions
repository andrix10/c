CISP 400 C++ Programming
Inheritance . 2013 David E. Fox
For this project you will start with a base class that will represent animals in a zoo: Animal.h and Animal.o. I will provide this base class and the object code1 needed to link it to your code.
From this generic type you will inherit derived classes:
1) Mammal
	. Body temperature: double
	. Functions to return and update Body temperature.
	. Boolean function: is body temperature is in range.
2) Reptile
	. Environment-Type: water or land
	. Functions to return and update Environment-Type
	From these you will inherit derived classes:
a) Mammal
i) Elephant
	. Diet-type: Herbivore
	. Feed-type: Hay
	. Body temp: 97-98 deg
	. Weight-in-pounds: double (12000 . 15000)
	. Functions to return and update Weight-in-pounds
	. Boolean function: is body weight in range.
ii) Skunk
	. Diet-type: Omnivore
	. Feed-type: grubs and grass shoots
	. Body temp: 95 - 97 deg.
	. De-scented: bool
	. Functions to return and update De-scented
1 DO NOT change either of these . DO NOT write Animal.cpp
b) Reptile
i) Python
	. Diet-type: Carnivore
	. Feed-type: live mice
	. Environment type: land
	. Length-in-feet: double (15 . 23)
	. Functions to return and update Length-in-feet
	. Boolean function: length is in range
ii) Crocodilia
	. Diet-type: Carnivore
	. Feed-type: raw-meat
	. Environment type: water
	. Subgroup: Croc-type enum {
	CrocTypeUnknown, Crocodile, Alligator,
	Caiman, Gharial }
	. Functions to return and update Croc-type
I will give you:
3) Bird
	. Can-it-fly: bool
	. Functions to return and update Can-it-fly
From Bird I will provide:
i) Eagle
	. Diet-type: Carnivore
	. Feed-type: raw meat
	. Endangered status: bool
	. Functions to return and update endangered status: bool.
We will discuss this in class to help to focus these classes.
Please note: we will not have any rattle snakes in our zoo.
